# COVID-19-Analysis

Scraper.py extracts the data from a JSON file available online and stores it to a database(COVID.sqlite).

Graph.py asks the user to enter the unique district id and shows a graph using matplotlib.
The X-axis of the graph represents the dates and the Y-axis represents confirmed, active, and recovered cases using 3 different curves.
